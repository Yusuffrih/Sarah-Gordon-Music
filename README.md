### Design Decisions

When designing the website, I carried out some market research to see what the general design choices for similar websites. I carried out [Google](https://www.google.com) searches to see if I could find websites which provided a similar service that I could take some inspiration from. As part of my research, I found that there was generally a bright, almost Spring time theme which was sleek and attractive throughout. This was in keeping with the wedding theme.

#### **Fonts** 
When deciding the fonts that I would use on this website, I searched through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to see if there were any fonts that looked attractive and sleek and that would look good when styled. I chose the *Cormorant Garamond* font due to its nice, stylish look which I though suited the sites look and feel. I decided have used *Sans-Serif* as a backup font in case [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) does not work for any reason. 

#### **Icons**

Icons used in this project were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Icons were used to style the links to the social media pages and contact information in the footer. Some icons were also used to help illustrate the pricing section on the booking page.  


#### **Colours**

When deciding what the colour scheme of my website would be, I did some research as mentioned above. I visited websites that had a similar purpose/goal to this one, Wedding Singers websites e.g. [https://weddingsinger.ie](https://weddingsinger.ie/). As previously mentioned, weddings generally tend to be themed with bright colours. This drove the decision around what the colour scheme would be, while being cognisant to keep it simple and not distracting from the content. 

I visited [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find a colour scheme which matched what I envisaged for the site. I chose the font colors and the background colors off of this palette.

font colours:
* For the general font in the body of the website, I chose **#4F646F** as it contrasted against the light coloured background image
* H1: I chose **#535657**, a navy colour which contrasted very well with the white marbled background image I chose to have throughout the website. This differed from the rest of the text very slightly so as to give it increased importance to the site user.
* Navbar, Testimonial containers and buttons were given a **#4F646F** this was to keep in scheme with the font. All items inside these elements were given a colour of **#F4FAFF** to contrast and make it easily readable.

#### **Images**
*Follow the below links to view the relative images*

* The [hero image](assets/images/general/SGM.jpg) used was original and was uploaded from my hardrive.
* Testimonial [profile photos](assets/images/testimonials) and the [background image](assets/images/general/augustine-wong-li0iC0rjvvg-unsplash.jpg) of marbling that were used were obtained from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

#### Wireframes

* I used Balsamic to wireframe from the outset as it was a much more attractive approach that drawing by hand. There were some minor changes made using the software. Below are the final itterations of the wireframes I based the website off in png. format.
