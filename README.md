## **User Experience (UX)**

### Project Goal


*The goal for this project is to offer a beautiful website that will quickly offer it's users an clear insight into the service being provided and the quality of that service that can be provided to them on their special day. Users will be able to easily make a customised booking*

### User Goals

### Site Owner Goals
As a site owner, I want:

* To direct traffic to my social network pages and increase popularity, personal brand and my fanbase.
* To provide website users with a positive user experience.
* To advertise recent customers' positive experiences and increase referrals.

* To give perspective customers an insight into my performing career & achievements.
* To give prospective customers an idea of the kind of person I am as they will be sharing their wedding day with me.

### User Requirements & Expectations

#### Requirements:

* To be able to navigate the website using the navbar
* To be able to hear the voice of the singer and to see her performing, giving the user a shop window view of the service being offered
* To be able to make a booking through the website without any bugs or issues
* To be able to quickly contact the site owner
* For the content of the page to be displayed in a way that is readible and attractive and promotes a positive user experience

#### Expectations:
* The existence of a nav-bar which makes it easy to navigate the website pages
* To be able to read about previous customers' experiences in a testimonials page
* Information about the site owner is easily found and gives a good sense of their abilities. This is essential when paying for this kind of service
* All of the design elements display in a seamless manner
* Text and images are clearly readable and contrast against their background
* If using a screen-reader, the non-text elements have aria labels

### Design Decisions

When designing the website, I carried out some market research to see what the general design choices for similar websites. I carried out [Google](https://www.google.com) searches to see if I could find websites which provided a similar service that I could take some inspiration from. As part of my research, I found that there was generally a bright, almost Spring time theme which was sleek and attractive throughout. This was in keeping with the wedding theme.

#### Fonts:
When deciding the fonts that I would use on this website, I searched through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to see if there were any fonts that looked attractive and sleek and that would look good when styled. I chose the *Cormorant Garamond* font due to its nice, stylish look which I though suited the sites look and feel. I decided have used *Sans-Serif* as a backup font in case [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) does not work for any reason. 

#### Icons:

Icons used in this project were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Icons were used to style the links to the social media pages and contact information in the footer. Some icons were also used to help illustrate the pricing section on the booking page.  


#### Colours:

When deciding what the colour scheme of my website would be, I did some research as mentioned above. I visited websites that had a similar purpose/goal to this one, Wedding Singers websites e.g. [https://weddingsinger.ie](https://weddingsinger.ie/). As previously mentioned, weddings generally tend to be themed with bright colours. This drove the decision around what the colour scheme would be, while being cognisant to keep it simple and not distracting from the content. 

I visited [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find a colour scheme which matched what I envisaged for the site. I chose the font colors and the background colors off of this palette.  

![color scheme](assets/images/color-scheme/ColourPalette-SarahGordonMusic.png)

font colours:
* For the general font in the body of the website, I chose **#4F646F** as it contrasted against the light coloured background image
* H1: I chose **#535657**, a navy colour which contrasted very well with the white marbled background image I chose to have throughout the website. This differed from the rest of the text very slightly so as to give it increased importance to the site user.
* Navbar, Testimonial containers and buttons were given a **#4F646F** this was to keep in scheme with the font. All items inside these elements were given a colour of **#F4FAFF** to contrast and make it easily readable.

#### Images
*Follow the below links to view the relative images*

* The [hero image](assets/images/general/SGM.jpg) used was original and was uploaded from my hardrive.
* Testimonial [profile photos](assets/images/testimonials) and the [background image](assets/images/general/augustine-wong-li0iC0rjvvg-unsplash.jpg) of marbling that were used were obtained from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

#### Wireframes

* I used Balsamic to wireframe from the outset as it was a much more attractive approach that drawing by hand. There were some minor changes made using the software. Below are the final itterations of the wireframes I based the website off in png. format.

2. [Tablet](tablet)
3. [Desktop](desktop)


## **Features**

### Features Implemented

* A beautiful and effective navigation through a navbar across each of the pages on the site.  
* A booking form which allows the prospective customer to contact the site owner easily. 
* Links to the site owners social media pages via slick Font Awesome icons. This is important as the site owner has a lot of content here which will give the prospective customers an in-depth view of the quality of the service provided in addition to what is on the website.  
* The site owner's contact information i.e. telephone number and email. These are needed in case the site visitor wants to contact the site owner and not make a booking. These are also displayed with Font Awesome icons. 
* A beautiful hero image of the site owner across the home page giving the site visitors positive emotions from the moment they land on the page. 
* Youtube video of the site owner displayed on the home page so that the site visitors can instantly see the service they will be paying for. 
* Audio file teasers of the music that will be sung at their weddings. 
* Responsive, mobile first layout that also looks great on tablets and desktops. This was done by using bootstrap's grid layout.
* Bootstrap buttons used to make a booking once the form is filled in. Bootstrap buttons to bring the site user to the 'Songs' & 'About Me' pages from the landing page. 
* An 'About Me' page which gives the potential customers an insight into what kind of person the site owner is as well as the previous work she has done as a singer and what the main achievements are.  
* A carousel to on the landing page to display the testimonials of the previous customers' positive experiences. 
* A pricing area that displays the prices of the different options available to perspective customers.


### Features Not Implemented
These features have not yet been implemented due to various reasons e.g. a lack of time

* Testimonials page - You will see from my wireframes that I originally planned on creating a Testimonials page to display the testimonials on one page, but I decided that it would be more efficient while also giving the user a better experience. 
* Modal - I wanted to have a modal appear when the user submitted their completed form. This would have been a nice piece of user feedback, however, due to scope of this project, I was not in a position to utilise it correctly. Modal code deleted from the Booking.html.  


## **Technologies**

The following technologies were used throughout the creation of the website: 

* [HTML 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - HTML5 is a markup language I used for structuring and presenting content of my site.

### Lighthouse Testing

* Lighthouse was used to assess the level of accessibility, performance and correctness that was provided by the site. This generated a report based on how the page performed against these criteria. It was great to use as, based on the results of the test, I could see where the scores fell down which prompted me to try and improve on the website.

The compatibility testing was **successful on all websites**, giving the website an equally attractive look and feel as well as functionality on all browsers. 

## Bugs

Below are some of the bugs that I came across throughout the development of the website:

### Resolved

**1.**

Bug: I could not figure out how to change the colour of the navigation items in the nav bar. 

Fix:  Went onto the chrome dev tools and began to investigate where the issue lay. I found the code that controlled the colour of the nav-items and then added this to my CSS. 

**2.**

Bug: I lost the controls on the testimonials carousel after I input the photos.

Fix: place the previous and next elements into the "carousel-inner" div

**3.**

Bug: 'Home' nav item on songs page was same colour as 'songs' when in the songs page

Fix: Removed the 'active' class from 'Home nav-item in the html code which gave it a different colour

**4.**

Bug: Options selector in form on bookings page was not being validated. 

Fix: added an empty value attribute to the placeholder option

**5.**

Bug: One of the testimonials was visible behind the rest of the carousel and you could see this as the next and previous buttons were pressed and the cards slid past.

Fix: Active class was placed in more than one of the testimonial carousel cards which caused the error. Removed from the extra carousel item.

**6.** 

Bug: The footer contact elements (email and phone number) were displaying well in certain screen sizes but then the icon would move to the next line. This did not look well. 

Fix: I input a couple of media queries which didn't stop it from happening but just made the overall look of the footer better when it did happen. 

**7.** 


### Unresolved

There were no bugs that I encountered that I did not resolve. I found Youtube and the resources that were available to us either by the Coding Institute or through slack or tutoring to be a really big help when problem solving.
