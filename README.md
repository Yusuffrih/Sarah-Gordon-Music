### Design Decisions

When designing the website, I carried out some market research to see what the general design choices for similar websites. I carried out [Google](https://www.google.com) searches to see if I could find websites which provided a similar service that I could take some inspiration from. As part of my research, I found that there was generally a bright, almost Spring time theme which was sleek and attractive throughout. This was in keeping with the wedding theme.

#### **Fonts** 
When deciding the fonts that I would use on this website, I searched through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to see if there were any fonts that looked attractive and sleek and that would look good when styled. I chose the *Cormorant Garamond* font due to its nice, stylish look which I though suited the sites look and feel. I decided have used *Sans-Serif* as a backup font in case [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) does not work for any reason. 

#### **Icons**

Icons used in this project were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Icons were used to style the links to the social media pages and contact information in the footer. Some icons were also used to help illustrate the pricing section on the booking page.  


#### **Colours**

When deciding what the colour scheme of my website would be, I did some research as mentioned above. I visited websites that had a similar purpose/goal to this one, Wedding Singers websites e.g. [https://weddingsinger.ie](https://weddingsinger.ie/). As previously mentioned, weddings generally tend to be themed with bright colours. This drove the decision around what the colour scheme would be, while being cognisant to keep it simple and not distracting from the content. 

I visited [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find a colour scheme which matched what I envisaged for the site. I chose the font colors and the background colors off of this palette.  

![color scheme](assets/images/color-scheme/ColourPalette-SarahGordonMusic.png)

font colours:
* For the general font in the body of the website, I chose **#4F646F** as it contrasted against the light coloured background image
* H1: I chose **#535657**, a navy colour which contrasted very well with the white marbled background image I chose to have throughout the website. This differed from the rest of the text very slightly so as to give it increased importance to the site user.
* Navbar, Testimonial containers and buttons were given a **#4F646F** this was to keep in scheme with the font. All items inside these elements were given a colour of **#F4FAFF** to contrast and make it easily readable.

#### **Images**
*Follow the below links to view the relative images*

* The [hero image](assets/images/general/SGM.jpg) used was original and was uploaded from my hardrive.
* Testimonial [profile photos](assets/images/testimonials) and the [background image](assets/images/general/augustine-wong-li0iC0rjvvg-unsplash.jpg) of marbling that were used were obtained from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

#### Wireframes

* I used Balsamic to wireframe from the outset as it was a much more attractive approach that drawing by hand. There were some minor changes made using the software. Below are the final itterations of the wireframes I based the website off in png. format.

## Features

### Features Implemented

* A beautiful and effective navigation through a navbar across each of the pages on the site.  
* A booking form which allows the prospective customer to contact the site owner easily. 
* Links to the site owners social media pages via slick Font Awesome icons. This is important as the site owner has a lot of content here which will give the prospective customers an in-depth view of the quality of the service provided in addition to what is on the website.  
* The site owner's contact information i.e. telephone number and email. These are needed in case the site visitor wants to contact the site owner and not make a booking. These are also displayed with Font Awesome icons. 
* A beautiful hero image of the site owner across the home page giving the site visitors positive emotions from the moment they land on the page. 
* Youtube video of the site owner displayed on the home page so that the site visitors can instantly see the service they will be paying for. 
* Audio file teasers of the music that will be sung at their weddings. 
* Responsive, mobile first layout that also looks great on tablets and desktops. This was done by using bootstrap's grid layout.
* Bootstrap buttons used to make a booking once the form is filled in. Bootstrap buttons to bring the site user to the 'Songs' & 'About Me' pages from the landing page. 
* An 'About Me' page which gives the potential customers an insight into what kind of person the site owner is as well as the previous work she has done as a singer and what the main achievements are.  
* A carousel to on the landing page to display the testimonials of the previous customers' positive experiences. 
* Sample recordings of the site owner singing some of the songs that would be sung at weddings.
* A pricing area that displays the prices of the different options available to perspective customers.


### Features Not Implemented
These features have not yet been implemented due to various reasons e.g. a lack of time

* Testimonials page - You will see from my wireframes that I originally planned on creating a Testimonials page to display the testimonials on one page, but I decided that it would be more efficient while also giving the user a better experience.
